Correlation between values of Bitcoin and Gold

I made this little project to start practice me with Jupyter notebook, pandas and matplotlib. I think that the "learn by doing" way is far more effective to get into things.

I downloaded the dataset of the historical values of Bitcoin (BTC) from: "https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history?p=BTC-USD" and I got the historical values of Gold.

I look at the correlation between the trends of the values of Bitcoin and the price of Gold.
